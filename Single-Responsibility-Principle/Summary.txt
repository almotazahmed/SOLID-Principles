=== SUMMARY ===
Each example demonstrates how the Single Responsibility Principle:
1. Makes classes focused on one specific task
2. Improves code maintainability and testability
3. Reduces coupling between different responsibilities
4. Makes the system more flexible and easier to extend
5. Follows the principle: 'A class should have only one reason to change'
